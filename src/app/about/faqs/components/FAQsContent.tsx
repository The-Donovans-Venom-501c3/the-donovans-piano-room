          became a 501(c)(3) organization in 2020.

    question: `Why are you called “The Donovan's Venom”?`,

        <br />
        <p>The Donovan is our founder.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The name “Venom” is often associated with negativity and harm, but we
          have chosen to repurpose the name to represent something positive. In
          our organization, “Venom” represents the power and strength that can
          be harnessed for good. The best thing about venom is that it&apos;s
          INFECTIOUS! We believe that everyone has the potential to make a
          positive impact on the world, and we are committed to empowering
          individuals to use their own “venom” to create change.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By using “venom” in a positive context, we can help to change these
          negative perceptions and promote a message of community and
          empowerment.
